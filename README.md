## 🎯 Usage

Each script is designed to be run standalone. Here’s how they work:

### 📊 CPU Monitoring

```bash
./scripts/cpu_monitor.sh
```

**What it does:**

- Displays real-time CPU usage.
- Shows system load averages.

### 🧠 Memory Monitoring

```bash
./scripts/memory_monitor.sh
```

**What it does:**

- Shows available and used RAM.
- Helps in detecting memory-hungry applications.

### 💾 Disk Monitoring

```bash
./scripts/disk_monitor.sh
```

**What it does:**

- Lists all mounted partitions and their usage.
- Alerts when disk space is low.

### 🌐 Network Monitoring

```bash
./scripts/network_monitor.sh
```

**What it does:**

- Shows active network interfaces and their IP addresses.
- Monitors network traffic using `sar`.

### 🧐 Process Monitoring

```bash
./scripts/process_monitor.sh
```

**What it does:**

- Lists top resource-consuming processes.
- Helps in killing unwanted processes (if needed).

### 🎮 Game Monitoring

```bash
./scripts/game_monitor.sh
```

**What it does:**

- Detects running games (because FPS drops matter! 🎮💔).
- Monitors their CPU and memory usage.

## 🛡️ Running as Root?

Some scripts require root privileges for full functionality. If you see this warning:

```bash
Run as root for full details!
```

Simply execute the script with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/network_monitor.sh
```
